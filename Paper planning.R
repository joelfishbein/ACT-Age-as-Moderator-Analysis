# Examine moderation of pain outcomes by age
1. Older adults improve more on pain severity during intervention, get worse more after
2. Older adults improve more on pain interference during intervention, get worse more after

# Potential covariates of change in pain
3. CPAQ - no difference in amt of change by age
4. Depression - Older adults improve marginally more more during intervention, no difference in FU slopes
5. Sleep - no difference in amt of change by age

# Demonstrating depression as a covariate of change in pain interference but not severity
6. Change in depression -> Change in pain severity (over Pre-Post)
7. Change in depression -> Change in pain interference (over Pre-Post)
